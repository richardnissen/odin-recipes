    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a recipe for pancakes
    </p>
    <p>
        I prefer to make mine vegan
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups plant milk of choice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, add your 3 wet ingredients in a bowl and stir to combine.
            The vinegar will curdle the milk slightly, giving you a quick
            "buttermilk."</li>
        <li>In a seperate bowl, add your 3 dry ingredeints and stir to combine.
            This step is important as it let's you evenly incorporate the baking
            powder into the flour.</li>
        <li>Add your wet ingredients to your dry ingredients and whisk to
            combine. Let rest 3 to 5 minutes. While you preheat a nonstick
            skillet over medium. </li>
        <li>When the skillet is warm, add 3 x 4in circles of pancake batter to
            the skillet. (If you use a ¼ measuring cup to transfer the batter to
            the skillet, this is a little less than a full ¼ cup.)</li>
        <li>Let the pancakes cook until they begin to bubble and the edges start
            to crisp. When the underside has turned a golden brown color,
            flip over and cook on the other side. After the pancakes are done,
            transfer to a plate or a sheet tray in the oven and repeat the
            process until all of the pancakes are done. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
