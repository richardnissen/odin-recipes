    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a recipe for a pizza
    </p>
    <p>
        I prefer to make mine vegan
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can white beans</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cashews</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>5 cups fresh spinach</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can artichoke hearts, drained</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 pre-made pizza dough</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegan mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 °F.</li>
        <li>Rinse an drain the canned white beans and put them in a blender
            together with the cashews, the lemon juice, the water, and the
            nutritional yeast. If you want to make it a bit easier for
            your blender, you can soak them in water for 4-6 hours
            before using them. Put aside.</li>
        <li>Heat some oil in a large pan and sauté the onion for about 3
            minutes until they become translucent. After 2 minutes, add
            the garlic. Then add 2 cups of the spinach and cook for 3 more
            minutes. Stir in the blended white bean and cashew mixture.
            Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Evenly spread on the pizza dough. Cut the artichoke hearts in
            quarters and put them on the pizza together with the remaining
            spinach. Sprinkle with the vegan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for 8 minutes or check out the instructions on
            the package (each pre-made pizza dough is different). Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
